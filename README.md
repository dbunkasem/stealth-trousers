# stealth-trousers
For this project, I customized a pair of old pants. I started by cutting and tapering the pants to fit my body. Then I used the left-over fabric to create a pocket and belt loops. I painted a piece of fabric with blue thermochromic paint and created a design with conductive thread. After that, I placed the conductive thread under the fabric with the paint. These two layers were then sewn onto the outside of the pocket. I created a circuit by connecting the layer with conductive thread to a battery and metal snaps. After the circuit was completed, I added other materials as accessories like utility straps and metal hoops.
